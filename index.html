            <h2>About Me</h2>	
            <p> <br> Karleca James is enrolled as an undergraduate junior at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. She is studying to minor in information technology and is dedicated to getting her bachelor’s in civil engineering. After receiving her associate in the arts from her local Hillsborough Community College in 2022, she decided to continue her education and transferred from Tampa to Tallahassee in the Fall of 2024. Between the time she was enrolled at these institutions, she worked at a few different side jobs. Going from an excellent student earning dean-list most semesters to working minimum wage, she knew she had more potential than what she was doing. So, at the beginning of 2024, Karleca decided to set and achieve part one of her goals of getting into a university to earn her bachelor’s.</p>
			<p> <br> Karleca was born in Bronx, New York, but ethnically, she is Antiguan. Antigua is a small island in the Caribbean where my parents and grandparents were born. It is a beautiful island with many beaches but not a place to raise the next generation. Conditions like no electricity, running water, or a/c were common. Her parents wanted a better future for themselves and their kids, leading to Karleca being born in New York. This is one of Karleca’s motivations to give back to her family and other deserving souls some of life’s basic luxuries with her degree. </p> 
			<p> <br>Karleca has spent most of her life living in Tampa, Florida; her education K-12, college, and home were at most 10 miles away from each other. Karleca attended Tampa Bay Technical High School with trades and shops like nursing, welding, veterinary, art, culinary, and more. These classes would be part of every student’s schedule, increasing yearly until graduation. Since she was a creative who did well in math and science courses, she chose architecture, which started her passion for engineering. Those became her favorite classes; she excelled at them and became certified in programs professionals would use. Through this experience, she found a career she could see herself enjoying. </p>
